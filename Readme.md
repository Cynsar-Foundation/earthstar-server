# Earthstar Meets CF

## Overview

This project leverages Earthstar, an open-source library for building peer-to-peer (p2p) applications, to create and deploy static websites on a private distributed network. By using Earthstar's sync capabilities, website content is replicated across multiple devices in a network, ensuring high availability and resilience. The project is designed for individuals and organizations that require a decentralized approach to hostingâ€”enhancing privacy and control over their content.

## Features

1. Earthstar is an offline-first database.
2. Earthstar is a key-value database which supports author versions.
3. Earthstar data is mutable.
4. Earthstar databases can sync
5. Earthstar databases are private
6. Earthstar works in the browser

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

- Deno

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these instructions:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone earthstar-server
    cd
    ```
2. Now you need to create your shareAddress and a secret though we are not going to use the secret at this point.
    ```sh
    deno
    import * as Earthstar from "https://deno.land/x/earthstar/mod.ts";
    let shareKeypair = await Earthstar.Crypto.generateShareKeypair("gardening");
    ```
3. Copy and paste the shareAddress in known_shares.json
    ```sh
    "+gardening.......",
    ```
4. Run deno:
    ```sh
    deno run server.ts
    ```
This will run a local server that can sync your data only if the known_shares are provided.Remember this is a private network unlike regular peer to peer network where peers are discovered. In Earthstar discovery takes places given you have a shareAddress beforehand.

## Usage

- Use the CF Earthstar CLI or an Earthstar-enabled application to publish and sync your static website content across your private network.
- There is a [repository](https://github.com/cynsar-foundation/earthlink) includes a simple static site generator. Create your assets (HTML, CSS, JS) within the designated folders and run the build script to prepare them for distribution: (Use the shareAddress and secret from the above)
    ```sh
    deno run deploy --name projectName -shareAddress address --secret secret
    ```
- Distribute the built assets across the network using Earthstar's sync functionality:
    ```sh
    deno sync --address 'https://pub.cynsar.foundation' || 'http://localhost:8080'
    ```
- Your website is now hosted and distributed on the private network and can be accessed through any peer with the content synced.
- Your website will be available on the network here `https://serve.cynsar.foundation/{projectName}`
